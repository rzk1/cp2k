known issues:
 keywords are confusing: penalty section is not required in most ALMO sections, most keywords in the penalty subsection of the NLMO section are not needed

 print out is confusing: determinants are not clearly printed

 virtual orbitals require substantial refactoring

 preconditioner is badly needed

 test files require clear comments, tests must show how to print NLMO, CLMO, and OLMOs, each code feature must be tested only once, options in all tests files should be set so a test runs under 30 seconds on 1 core
